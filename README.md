# Discord-Bot-Python
A simple Discord bot made using Python.

This is a program designed to work with the discord.py library used to access Discord's bot API and create a bot.

It is very complicated and has features you may not find useful, so if you can understand the code and remove the parts you don't need, I'm happy for the use of this code elsewhere.
